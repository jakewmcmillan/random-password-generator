# random-password-generator

This is a random password generator that I created using Javascript and some starter HTML/CSS.  It is designed so that a user can input paramaters to create a random password and it will give them a random sequence of charachters fitting their given input.  This was an interesting project that really foced me to focus on my Javascript and run various console.logs to make sure that I wasn't breaking anything along the way.  

Overall, this project honed my Javascript ability and let me put into practice the skills that we learned in class.  It caused me to fill in the cracks of what I did not pick up and rolled what we learned about HTML, CSS and Javascript and roll them into one succinct, functioning, application.  Below you will find a link to my project along with a screenshot of how it looks when deployed.
